Onkyo Remote App for MacOSX menu bar.

This App is able to redirect MacOSX sounds to your Onkyo receiver using "icecast" & "darkice" deamon
You need to install a dedicated audio driver to capture Mac sounds such as the one from AirBeamTV http://bit.ly/2lTqyDQ
You can use any other driver, but then you need to change the configuration and script files contained in this App (in Content/Resources/castSW/ directory).

You can also edit content of the "OnkyoRemote.ini" file contained in this App container (in Content/Resources/ directory), to create your own commands for any specific Onkyo equipment.

A precompiled version is available in the "release" @ https://github.com/lebera/OnkyRemote/releases
