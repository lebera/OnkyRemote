Onkyo Remote App for MacOSX menu bar.
This App is able to redirect MacOSX sounds to your Onkyo receiver using "icecast" & "darkice" deamon
You need to install a dedicated audio driver to capture Mac sounds such as the one from AirBeamTV http://bit.ly/2lTqyDQ
You can use any other driver, but then you need to change the configuration and script files contained in this App (in Content/Resources/castSW/ directory).
Then you need to edit content of the "OnkyoRemote.ini" file contained in this App (in Content/Resources/ directory), at least to specify the correct IP address of your Onkyo equipment.
You can also create your own commands for any specific Onkyo equipment

A precompiled version is available in the "release" @ https://github.com/lebera/OnkyRemote/releases
